## Introduction

Virtual Tour of Bhimsen Tower is a semester project for CSC-254 Computer Graphics at St. Xavier's College delivered in 2015 by [Narayan Panthi, Siddhant Rimal and Sneha Prasai](https://siddhantrimal.github.io/VTBT#team) under the supervision of Er. Anil Sah. Inspired, by the catasthrophic 2015 Nepal earthquake, to digitize preservation acts, VTBT is a step towards virtualizing heritage sites and monuments in order to digitally preserve them for the benefit of future generations. The intention of the developers is to show that, with enough data and development, projects like this can be feasibly ported to other platforms such as AR which allows a deeper level of integration regarding the interaction with the environment.
